  <p class="description-pointe">During a classical dance lesson arise several problems: the only reference that the dancer has is that of the teacher
      who tries to remember movements through gestures, to record the choreography are used paper notes that must be replaced every time it is made
      a change, the confusion given by the high number of steps and movements to do.
      In the ballet class there is only one teacher who must try to give the same attention to each student, this involves 
      a great waste of time, moreover not all dancers have the same view of the teacher.</p>
